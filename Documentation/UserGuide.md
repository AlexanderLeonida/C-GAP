## Troubleshooting
If you follow the manual and at any point you feel that you are at the wrong step
1. Reread the last instruction in the manual. Did you miss something?
2. If the terminal is blank, is the terminal stuck, or is the program still running?
3. [Double check](#variables) the order of the parameters being input into the creation of a City Object  
4. Is the [simulate() method](#simulate) being printed to the terminal via std::cout?
5. If you are somehow stuck in an **INFINITE** loop, press "fn" + "c" or "control" + "c" to end the process and try to [run](#section-1-running-the-program) the program again with different values.
6. If everything went wrong, reset [main.cpp](../source/main.cpp) to one of it's original states [here](#reset)
